<h1>The Best Movies According to Liv</h1>

<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>One of the most beautiful and inspiring movies I´ve ever seen, for me it felt like everyting I always wanted to say and never did.</p>

<h3>Boyhood</h3>
<p>This movie for me has one of the most realistc representations of what growing up feels like. Something I noticed about the footage was how the colors became more neutral as the years were passing.</p>


<h3>Stand By Me</h3>
<p>Classic 80´s movie, It felt so personal watching those kids dealing with the real mystery of the film: how to say goodbye to your youth?</p>


<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>This movie got me thinking even more about how much wasted potention we have in this world, I loved seeing Will overcome his traumas and start a new life</p>

<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting romance films made in my opinion, it didn´t need a big plot twist, it´s simple and honest just by showing the couple´s connection through dialogue</p>

<h3>Alice in Wonderland</h3>
<p>My favourite childhood film of all time! I identify a lot with Alice´s desire for a world of her own.</p>
