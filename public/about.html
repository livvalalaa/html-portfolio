<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lívia Valala, but many refer to me as Liv. I was born in 2006, which means I recently entered 
  the world of developers and I´m already making significant progress and evolving.</p>

<p>I started by studying C#, which helped me understand the foundation for other languages. Now, I´m taking
  a course with the wonderful Angela Yu to specialize in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On this website, you can
  find two projects I worked on after attending the HTML classes, in addition to this portfolio itself.
</p>

<p>I learn quickly and am envolving daily. I find programming to be a great way to keep up with the constant
  changes in the world. That´s one of the main reasons why I became interested in this field.
